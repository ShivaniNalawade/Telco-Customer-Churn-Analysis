Telco Customer Churn Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

2️⃣ Short Description

This Power BI project analyzes customer churn in a Telco company to identify key drivers of revenue loss. An interactive dashboard was built using Power Query and DAX to monitor churn rate, revenue impact, and customer behavior across contracts, payment methods, and tenure segments.

3️⃣ Business Problem
The organization is currently facing a significant level of customer churn, resulting in revenue loss and reduced customer retention. Management aims to analyze customer behavior across multiple KPIs to understand the key factors contributing to churn.
The company seeks to identify which performance indicators require improvement and determine effective strategies or plans to reduce churn. By analyzing customer segments, contract types, payment methods, internet services, and tenure patterns, the organization aims to develop data-driven solutions to improve retention and overall business performance.

6️⃣ Key Insights
1. Month-to-month contract customers exhibit the highest churn rate (42.71%), indicating that lack of long-term commitment significantly increases attrition risk.
2. Customers using Electronic Check as a payment method show the highest churn (45.29%), suggesting lower engagement or payment friction compared to auto-payment users.
3. Fiber optic internet subscribers have a churn rate of 41.89%, despite being a high-revenue segment, highlighting potential service dissatisfaction or pricing sensitivity.
4. Customers with less than 12 months tenure demonstrate the highest churn risk, confirming that early-stage customers are the most vulnerable segment.
5. Revenue is heavily concentrated in Fiber Optic and Month-to-Month segments, which also exhibit high churn rates. This indicates that a significant portion of revenue is at risk, as high-value customers belong to high-churn segments.

7️⃣ Business Recommendations
1. Encourage customers to switch to long-term contracts to reduce churn risk.
2. Promote auto-payment methods to improve customer commitment and reduce payment-related churn.
3. Strengthen onboarding and engagement efforts during the first year of customer tenure.
4. Investigate fiber optic service issues to address dissatisfaction in high-churn segments.
5. Implement targeted retention campaigns for high-risk customer groups.
